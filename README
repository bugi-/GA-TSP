A parallel genetic algortihm for solving the travelling sales man problem. Final project for the course Tools of High Performance Computing at University of Helsinki.

Requirements:
 Current implementation relies on a gnu extension so gfortran should be used. Makefile also uses gfortran for now.

Usage:
 compile with:
  'make' for main program
  'make main_debug' for bounds checking etc. for main
  'make test' for a simple and inconclusive unit test suite (still much better than most scientific computing programs I have seen)
  
  use with:
   Set parameters for the run in the file 'preferences' and run 'main'. Output is normally to stdout.
  

Notes:
 A Git repository is included in the working folder.
